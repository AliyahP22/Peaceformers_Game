# Peaceformers_Game

Instructions:
To play this game, the user(which is the pink circle) would use their keyboard to control the player in capturing all of the resources(the cyan circles). The main objective of this game is to gather as much resources as they can to share out to the village and maintain peace. Each time the player collects a resource, they would gain points. There would be random events in which the user would be able to either gain or lose points. If the user gets a treasure chest, they would earn 50 resources, if they get a potion, they would gain a health and some resources, but if they get a monster, they lose a life.
